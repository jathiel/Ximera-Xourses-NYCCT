\section{Dataframes}

Dataframes reprensent a class that is even more complicated than arrays.
Essentially, a dataframe is a collection of arrays with additional methods
that will allow us to look at, organize, and manipulate data on a spreadsheet.

be using can be found \href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16JH90ktosyA_SPWT-xH6zZVnfysOhNpd?usp=sharing}{here}.
