\section{Discrete Models}

The definition of a discrete set is beyond the scope of this class, so
instead we will illustrate the concept via examples and non-examples. Examples
of discrete (sub)sets of the real line include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the integers and
	\item rationals with a denominator of 2 or 3.
\end{itemize}
Examples of (sub)sets of the real line that are not discrete include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the real line,
	\item all rationals, and
	\item the open interval $(0,1)$.
\end{itemize}
One way of thinking of a discrete set is that its elements must be
``isolated" from each other. 

Discrete sets and models are important in 
this setting since we are using a computer, which cannot perfectly model
a continuous process. In many cases, we wish to model over discrete data
(like in a recurrence relation) or we may try to approximate a 
continuous model using a discrete one (this idea will be revisited in 
MAT4880 since, in some cases, such approximations do not work).

\section{Examples}

\subsection{A Population Model}

Suppose that observations of the local turtle population in a nearby 
lake show that the population follows the following trends:
\begin{itemize}
	\item When first observed, the population of turtles was 20
	in the year 2010.
	\item Every 5 years about half the turtles die off and 15
	new turtles are born.
\end{itemize}
What will be the long-term behavior of this population? What happens
to the population should some of our initial assumptions change?

\begin{sageCell}
# Turtle population problem
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [20]
r = 15 # try these values 0.75, 1.5, 2.3, 2.6, 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.8
for i in range(100):
    x.append(0.5*x[-1]+r)
             
plt.scatter(range(101),x)
plt.show()
\end{sageCell}

\subsection{The Logistic Map}

The logistic map is a recurrence relation that is a discrete 
approximation to a commonly used population model. It is given by
\begin{align*}
	x_0 &= c\\
	x_{n+1} &= rx_n(1-x_n)
\end{align*}
for a pair of constants $c$ and $r$. Taking $c=0$, we can plot 
$x_0$ to $x_{100}$ for various choices of $r$ to see how it affects
the result. 

\begin{sageCell}
# An example of the logistic map
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [0.5]
r = 3.8 # try these values 0.75, 1.5, 2.3, 2.6, 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.8
for i in range(100):
    x.append(r*x[-1]*(1-x[-1]))
             
plt.scatter(range(101),x)
plt.show()
\end{sageCell}
