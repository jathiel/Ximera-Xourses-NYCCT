\section{Recursion}

Recursion is involved when an object's definition refers to itself. We illustrate this idea via an example.

The factorial function is defined over the nonnegative integers in the following way: $0!=1$, for $n\geq 1$, $n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 1$. Note that in order to compute $n!$ for $n>2$, one first needs to compute $(n-1)!$. So we can define the factorial function one number at a time. We let $$n!=\begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $n=0$}\\ n\cdot(n-1)! & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$

This new way of defining $n!$ highlights the idea that to solve the problem of computing $n!$, one first must solve the similar, but smaller problem, of computing $(n-1)!$. Recursion typically comes up when this is the case.

Another example of recursion is given by the \link[Fibonacci sequence]{https://plus.maths.org/content/fibonacci-sequence-brief-introduction}. We define $f_n$, the $n$th Fibonacci number, for $n\geq 0$ as $$f_n=\begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $n=0,1$}\\ f_{n-1}+f_{n-2} & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$ Computing recursively, we see that this definition yields the sequence $1,1,2,3,5,8,\dots$. That is, for every $n\geq 2$, $f_n$ is the sum of the previous two terms in the sequence. We implement this function in Python below.

\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def fib(n):
        if n < 2:
                return 1
        else:
                return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

fib(5)
==============================
\end{verbatim}

Every recursively defined function has two key ingredients:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item the base case(s): these are known values of the function that will be used as a starting point for computing other values and 
	\item the inductive case: this is the rule for computing the function at unknown values using previously known values.
	\end{enumerate}

If either ingredient above is missing, then the function will not be defined correctly. (Can you think of why?)

Some advantages of using recursively defined functions:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recursively definied functions can be easy to implement in Python.
		\item In many cases recursion is the only known way to define certain functions.

	\end{itemize}

A major dissadvantage of using a recursive definition is that it can require a lot of time to compute something. For example, computing $f_{100}$ in using the function above will take an extremely long period of time. This happens because the Python function `forgets' that it has already computed a certain quantity. In the case of $f_{100}$, the program will first attempt to compute $f_{99}$, but to compute that it will first attempt to compute $f_{98}$ and so on. After finally evaluating $f_{99}$ it will attempt to compute $f_{98}$ again, not realizing that it has done that before. In a future lesson we will discuss how we can reduce the time needed to compute such values.

Another well-known example of a problem with a recursive solution is the \link[Tower of Hanoi]{https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html} problem. In this problem, if we define $H(n)$ to be the minimum number of moves needed to move the $n$ disk tower from one post to another, then $$H(n) = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if $n=1$}\\ 2H(n-1) + 1 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$ While this is clearly recursive, it can also be shown (using an inductive proof) that $H(n)=2^n-1$. (Being able to give an explicit formula this way is not possible in every case.)

\section{Problems}

\begin{question}
	Define a sequence $a_n$ for $n\geq 0$ by $$a_n=\begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $n=0$}\\ 3 & \text{if $n=1$}\\a_{n-1}-a_{n-2} & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$ Compute $a_7$. $\answer{-1}$
	\begin{hint}
		The definition of $a_n$ is similar to that of the Fibonacci sequence.
	\end{hint}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Implement the recursive definition of $H(n)$ in Python. Note that the hint for this problem is the solution.
	\begin{hint}
\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def H(n):
        if n == 1:
                return 1
        else:
                return 2*H(n-1)+1
==============================
\end{verbatim}
	\end{hint}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Suppose you can climb a set of stairs by either taking one stair or three stairs at once per step. In how many ways can you climb 9 stairs?
	\begin{hint}
	One way to establish the base cases is to compute the number of ways to climb 1, 2, or 3 stairs. (Why 2?)
	\end{hint}
	\begin{hint}
\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def stair(n):
        if n == 1:
                return 1
        elif n == 2:
                return 1
        elif n == 3:
                return 2
        else:
                return stair(n-3)+stair(n-1)
==============================
\end{verbatim}
\end{hint}
The number of ways to climb 9 stairs using this method is $\answer{19}$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
McDonald's used to sell nuggets only in packages of size 6, 9, and 20. What is the largest number of nuggest that cannot be ordered using such sizes? $\answer{43}$
	\begin{hint}
Create a recursively defined function named \verb|nugget| that returns a 1 if $n$ nuggets can be ordered and returns a 0 otherwise. Be sure to create a case for when $n<6$.
	\end{hint}
	\begin{hint}
	If a number $n$ can be ordered, then either $n=6,9,20$ or one of $n-6$, $n-9$, or $n-20$ can be ordered. The \verb|max| function can help here since we only need at least one of \verb|nugget(n-6)|, \verb|nugget(n-9)|, or \verb|nugget(n-20)| to be equal to 1.
	\end{hint}
	\begin{hint}
	Once you find 6 consecutive numbers that can be ordered, we should be able to determine which is the largest number that cannot be ordered. (Why?) Note that the fourth hint for this problem contains the code for \verb|nugget|.
	\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
\begin{verbatim}
==============================
def nugget(n):
        if n < 6:
                return 0
        if n == 6 or n == 9 or n == 20:
                return 1
        else:
                return max(nugget(n-6),nugget(n-9),nugget(n-20))
==============================
\end{verbatim}
	\end{hint}
The largest number of nuggets that cannot be ordered is $\answer{43}$.
\end{question}
